This project is a backend implementation for login, profile management, and chat features using NestJS, MongoDB, and Node.js, containerized with Docker. The system follows best practices in authentication (JWT), data validation (DTO), real-time communication (Socket.io), and unit testing.

The chat functionality is designed with object-oriented programming and efficient data structures, ensuring optimal schema planning and microservices in NoSQL.

### Features Implemented
    1. Authentication & Profile Management

    JWT-based authentication (signup/login).
    Profile creation & update (fields extracted from Figma, including horoscope & zodiac).
    User validation using DTO for structured API requests.

    2. Real-time Chat System

    Private messaging between users (User A â†” User B).
    Message history storage in MongoDB.
    RabbitMQ-based message notification for real-time updates.
    Socket.io for live chat experience.

    3. CRUD Operations & Schema Design

    Well-structured NoSQL schema for login, profile, and chat.
    Object-oriented programming principles applied in service layers.
    Efficient data structures for handling chat storage and retrieval.
